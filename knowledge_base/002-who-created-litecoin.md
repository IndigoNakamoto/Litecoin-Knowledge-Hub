# Who Created Litecoin?

## The Creator: Charlie Lee
Litecoin (LTC) was created by Charlie Lee, a computer scientist and early cryptocurrency adopter. Lee graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computer science. Before creating Litecoin, he honed his skills as a software engineer at several tech companies, most notably at Google, where he worked from 2007 to 2013 on projects including Chrome OS and YouTube Mobile.

Lee's direct experience with Bitcoin in its early years inspired him to develop a complementary cryptocurrency. He envisioned Litecoin not as a competitor to Bitcoin, but as a "lightweight" version that could handle transactions more quickly and cheaply. This led to his famous analogy of Litecoin being the "silver to Bitcoin's gold," suggesting it was better suited for smaller, everyday payments while Bitcoin served as a store of value. He developed and launched Litecoin in 2011 while still employed at Google.

## The Launch of Litecoin
Charlie Lee first released the open-source code for Litecoin on GitHub on October 7, 2011, and the network officially went live on October 13, 2011. A core principle of its creation was the concept of a "fair launch." This meant:

* **No Pre-mine:** Unlike many later cryptocurrencies, no coins were mined or allocated to the founder or a development team before the public launch.
* **No ICO:** There was no Initial Coin Offering to raise funds.

Every user had an equal opportunity to acquire the first Litecoins through mining, mirroring the launch of Bitcoin and establishing a foundation of trust and decentralization within the community.

To achieve his goal of a "lighter" version of Bitcoin, Lee made several key technical modifications:

| Feature           | Litecoin (LTC)                     | Bitcoin (BTC)                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Hashing Algorithm** | Scrypt                             | SHA-256                              |
| **Block Time** | ~2.5 minutes                       | ~10 minutes                          |
| **Max Supply** | 84 million                         | 21 million                           |
| **Core Analogy** | "Digital Silver"                   | "Digital Gold"                       |

The choice of the **Scrypt** algorithm was intended to make mining more accessible to individuals using standard CPUs and GPUs by being more resistant to the specialized ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners that quickly came to dominate Bitcoin mining. The **2.5-minute block time** allows for faster transaction confirmations, while the **84 million coin supply** (four times Bitcoin's) reinforces the "silver" analogy of greater abundance.

Litecoin has also served as a valuable testbed for new technologies. Notably, it successfully implemented the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade in May 2017, months before Bitcoin. This provided a real-world demonstration of the technology's benefits and safety, effectively de-risking its later adoption by Bitcoin.

## Role and Influence Post-Creation
After creating Litecoin, Charlie Lee continued to be a major figure in its development and the broader crypto industry. He left Google in 2013 to join the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as Director of Engineering, a position he held until 2017.

In 2016, Lee founded the **Litecoin Foundation**, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the adoption and development of Litecoin. As Managing Director, he guides the Foundation's efforts to support the ecosystem, which operates on community donations due to the fair-launch model.

In a move that generated significant discussion, Lee announced in December 2017 that he had **sold and donated all of his personal LTC holdings**. His stated reason was to eliminate any potential conflict of interest, allowing him to speak and work on Litecoin's development without his motives being questioned. While some critics viewed this as a loss of faith, many supporters praised it as an act of commitment to decentralization.

Despite having no financial stake, Lee remains the most prominent advocate for Litecoin. He actively leads development efforts, including the implementation of privacy-enhancing features like MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB), and serves as the public face of the project, ensuring its continued presence and evolution in the cryptocurrency landscape.
