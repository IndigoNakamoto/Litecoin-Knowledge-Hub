# High-Level Design (HLD)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the Litecoin
RAG Chat application. It outlines the major components, their responsibilities, and the
interactions between them.

## 2. System Architecture

The system is designed as a microservices-based architecture, with a clear separation of
concerns between the frontend, backend, and content management system.

### 2.1. Components

*   **Frontend (Next.js):** A React-based web application that provides the user
    interface for the chatbot. It communicates with the backend via a RESTful API.

*   **Backend (FastAPI):** A Python-based application that serves as the core of the
    system. It handles the following responsibilities:
    *   **API Gateway:** Exposes a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with.
    *   **RAG Pipeline:** Manages the retrieval-augmented generation process,
        including querying the vector store and generating responses using a
        large language model (LLM).
    *   **Content Synchronization:** Listens for webhooks from the Payload CMS and
        updates the vector store accordingly.

*   **Content Management System (Payload CMS):** A headless, code-first CMS chosen
    for its high degree of customization, powerful `afterChange` hooks, and
    flexible content modeling capabilities. It serves as the canonical source of
    truth for the knowledge base, providing a robust, Foundation-controlled
    editorial workflow for content creators and editors.

*   **Database (MongoDB):**
    *   **Content Store:** A MongoDB database used by the Payload CMS to store the
        raw content.
    *   **Vector Store:** A MongoDB Atlas collection with vector search capabilities
        to store and query document embeddings.

### 2.2. Data Flow

1.  **Content Creation/Update:**
    *   Content creators and editors use the Payload CMS to create, update, and
        publish articles.
*   When an article is published or updated, Payload's `afterChange` hook
    triggers a notification to the FastAPI backend.
    *   The backend receives the webhook, fetches the updated content from the
        Payload CMS API, processes it, generates embeddings, and updates the
        vector store.

2.  **User Interaction:**
    *   A user enters a query into the chat interface.
    *   The Next.js frontend sends the query to the FastAPI backend.
    *   The backend's RAG pipeline converts the query into a vector embedding.
    *   The vector embedding is used to search for similar documents in the
        vector store.
    *   The retrieved documents are used as context for a large language model
        (LLM) to generate a response.
    *   The response is streamed back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Langchain
*   **CMS:** Payload CMS
*   **Database:** MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas
*   **LLM:** Google Gemini
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Vercel (for frontend)

## 4. Scalability and Performance

The architecture is designed to be scalable. The frontend, backend, and CMS are
all independent services that can be scaled horizontally. The use of MongoDB
Atlas for the vector store also provides a scalable and managed solution.

Performance will be monitored and optimized as needed. Caching strategies can be
implemented at various levels (e.g., CDN for static assets, caching for API
responses) to improve response times.

## 5. Security

Security is a key consideration. The following measures will be implemented:

*   **Authentication:** The Payload CMS will have its own authentication system.
    The frontend will use a token-based authentication system to communicate with
    the backend.
*   **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to restrict
    access to different parts of the system.
*   **Input Validation:** All user input will be validated to prevent common
    security vulnerabilities, such as XSS and SQL injection.
*   **Secure Communication:** All communication between services will be encrypted
    using TLS.
