# Litecoin RAG Chat

## Project Overview
The Litecoin RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot is an AI-powered conversational tool designed to serve the Litecoin community by providing real-time, accurate answers to a wide range of questions. Its core strength lies in retrieving information from a human-vetted, curated knowledge base managed by the Litecoin Foundation. This ensures the information is not only accurate but also aligned with the Foundation's mission to combat misinformation and provide a single, trustworthy source for everything related to Litecoin. The chatbot aims to enhance user experience, foster greater adoption, and provide clear, reliable information about Litecoin's features, transaction management, development projects, and market insights.

**Target Users/Audience:** Litecoin users (novice and experienced), Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Developers building on Litecoin, Potential adopters seeking reliable information about Litecoin‚Äôs features, transactions, or market trends.

## Project Status
The project has successfully completed the **Core RAG Pipeline Implementation** (Milestone 3).

The project is currently focused on **Milestone 4: MVP Feature 1 Implementation (Litecoin Basics & FAQ)**. The backend and data ingestion pipeline for this milestone are **complete and validated**. The current focus is on developing the frontend chat interface and integrating it with the backend API.

## Key Features

## Content-First Approach
This project emphasizes a **content-first strategy**. The accuracy and reliability of the chatbot are directly tied to the quality of the information in its `knowledge_base/`. This directory houses meticulously researched, well-structured Markdown articles covering various Litecoin topics. These articles are the "golden source" for the RAG pipeline.

While the system can ingest data from other sources (web, GitHub, etc.), the primary focus for high-quality, trusted answers will always be the content within `knowledge_base/`.

    ```json
    {"message":"Hello World"}
    ```

### Running Data Ingestion

The `ingest_data.py` script has been refactored to support multiple data sources. You can specify the source type and identifier using command-line arguments.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if you haven't already):
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Ensure MongoDB Atlas Vector Search index is set up** as per `user_instructions/setup_mongodb_vector_index.md`.

4.  **Run the ingestion script with desired source:**

    *   **Litecoin Docs (Sample):**
        ```bash
        python ingest_data.py --source_type litecoin_docs --source_identifier data_ingestion/sample_litecoin_docs.md
        ```
    *   **YouTube (via Citeio API):**
        ```bash
        python ingest_data.py --source_type youtube --source_identifier "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id"
        ```
        (Replace `your_video_id` with an actual YouTube video ID)
    *   **Twitter (X) Posts:**
        ```bash
        python ingest_data.py --source_type twitter --source_identifier "litecoin,satoshi"
        ```
        (Replace `litecoin,satoshi` with comma-separated Twitter handles)
    *   **GitHub Repository (Markdown files):**
        ```bash
        python ingest_data.py --source_type github --source_identifier "https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin"
        ```
        (Replace with a valid GitHub repository URL)
    *   **Web Article:**
        ```bash
        python ingest_data.py --source_type web_article --source_identifier "https://litecoin.com/en/"
        ```
        (Replace with a valid web article URL)

5.  **Verify:**
    Confirm the script runs successfully and data is populated in your MongoDB Atlas collection.

    **Prioritizing Curated Content:**
    For the highest quality results, especially for the "Litecoin Basics & FAQ" feature, prioritize ingesting content from the `knowledge_base/` directory:
    ```bash
    python ingest_data.py --source_type markdown --source_identifier ../knowledge_base
    ```
    (This assumes you are in the `backend/` directory. Adjust the path if necessary.)

If you encounter any issues, please check the terminal output for error messages.
