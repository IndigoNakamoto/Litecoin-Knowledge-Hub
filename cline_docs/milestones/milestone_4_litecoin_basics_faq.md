# Milestone 4: MVP Feature 1 Implementation (Litecoin Basics & FAQ)

## Description
This milestone focuses on implementing the first core feature: providing answers to fundamental questions about Litecoin. This involves developing the frontend chat interface, integrating it with the RAG backend, and ensuring the RAG pipeline can accurately retrieve and generate responses for basic Litecoin queries. It also includes the curation and ingestion of relevant FAQ data.

## Key Tasks & Status

### Backend & Data Pipeline (Completed)
*   **Data Source Management:** Implemented a full CRUD API for managing knowledge base sources (`M4-DATASRC-001`).
*   **Knowledge Base Curation:** Established the foundational content structure and initial articles for the FAQ feature (`M4-KB-001`).
*   **Content Ingestion:** Successfully ingested the entire curated knowledge base (`articles` and `deep_research`) into the vector store, including bug fixes and validation (`M4-E2E-002`).
*   **Vector Index Enhancement:** Aligned the vector search index with all available metadata, enabling advanced filtering and completing the backend work for this milestone.
*   **End-to-End Validation:** Performed a full, clean ingestion and ran end-to-end tests to confirm the entire pipeline is functional (`M4-E2E-003`).

### Frontend Development (In Progress)
*   **UI Components (`M4-UI-001`):** Develop the frontend chat UI components. (Status: **To Do**)
*   **API Integration (`M4-INT-001`):** Integrate the frontend with the backend `/api/v1/chat` endpoint. (Status: **To Do**)
*   **End-to-End Testing (`M4-E2E-001`):** Conduct full testing of the FAQ feature through the UI. (Status: **To Do**)
