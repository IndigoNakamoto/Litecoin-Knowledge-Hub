# Milestone 4: Backend & Knowledge Base Completion (Initial Articles)

## Description
This milestone focuses on completing the backend work for the MVP and ingesting the initial set of knowledge base articles. This includes implementing a full CRUD API for managing data sources, curating and ingesting the "Litecoin Basics & FAQ" content, and enhancing the vector search index to support advanced metadata filtering.
