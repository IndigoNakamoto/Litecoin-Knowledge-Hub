# Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation

## Description
This milestone focuses on building the foundational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This includes setting up the Langchain framework, integrating with MongoDB Atlas for vector search, configuring the Google Text Embedding model, and implementing a robust, multi-source data ingestion framework.

## Key Tasks
*   [x] Set up Langchain project structure.
*   [x] Integrate Google Text Embedding 004 model.
*   [x] Configure MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for vector storage and retrieval.
*   [x] Develop initial data ingestion scripts for basic text data.
*   [x] Implement multi-source data ingestion framework (YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, Web Articles).
*   [x] Refactor `ingest_data.py` into a source router.
*   [ ] Implement the core retrieval mechanism.
*   [ ] Set up the LLM integration for generation.

## Estimated Time
40 hours (Estimated 20 hours so far)

## Status
In Progress (Multi-source Data Ingestion & Langchain Setup Complete; Focusing on Retrieval & Generation)

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 1 (Project Initialization & Documentation Setup)
*   Completed: Milestone 2 (Basic Project Scaffold)

## Acceptance Criteria
*   [x] Langchain is successfully integrated.
*   [x] Text embedding model is functional.
*   [x] MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is configured and accessible.
*   [x] Data from multiple sources (YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, Web Articles) can be ingested, embedded, and stored in the vector store via the dynamic `ingest_data.py` script.
*   [ ] A simple query can retrieve relevant documents and generate a coherent response using the LLM.
