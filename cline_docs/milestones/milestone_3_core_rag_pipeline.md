# Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation

## Description
This milestone focuses on building the foundational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This includes setting up the Langchain framework, integrating with MongoDB Atlas for vector search, configuring the Google Text Embedding model, and implementing a robust, multi-source data ingestion framework.

## Key Tasks
*   [x] **Architecture:** Set up Langchain project structure and basic API endpoints.
*   [x] **Embedding:** Integrate Google Text Embedding 004 model (requires API key setup).
*   [x] **Vector Store:** Configure MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for storage (requires account and index setup).
*   [x] **Data Ingestion (Development):** Implement multi-source data ingestion framework (YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, Web Articles) and refactor `ingest_data.py` into a source router.
*   [x] **Data Ingestion (Testing):** Test the multi-source ingestion pipeline to ensure data is correctly processed and stored in MongoDB.
*   [ ] **Retrieval:** Implement the core retrieval mechanism to perform similarity searches on the vector store.
*   [ ] **Generation:** Set up the LLM integration to generate responses based on retrieved context.

## Estimated Time
40 hours (Estimated 7 hours so far)

## Status
In Progress (Data Ingestion and Vector Store setup complete and tested. Next steps: Retrieval and Generation.)

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 1 (Project Initialization & Documentation Setup)
*   Completed: Milestone 2 (Basic Project Scaffold)

## Acceptance Criteria
*   [x] Langchain is successfully integrated into the FastAPI backend.
*   [x] The Google Text Embedding 004 model is functional and can create vectors (requires API key).
*   [x] MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is configured and accessible from the backend (requires account and index setup).
*   [x] The `ingest_data.py` script can be called with arguments for different data sources.
*   [x] The `ingest_data.py` script runs successfully without errors and populates the MongoDB collection with embedded data.
*   [ ] A user query can successfully retrieve relevant document chunks from the vector store.
*   [ ] The full pipeline can generate a coherent response using the LLM based on the retrieved documents.
