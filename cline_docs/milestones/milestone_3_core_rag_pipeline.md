# Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation

## Description
This milestone focuses on building the foundational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This includes setting up the Langchain framework, integrating with MongoDB Atlas for vector search, configuring the Google Text Embedding model, and implementing a robust, multi-source data ingestion framework.

## Key Tasks
*   [x] **Architecture:** Set up Langchain project structure and basic API endpoints.
*   [x] **Embedding:** Integrate Google Text Embedding 004 model (requires API key setup).
*   [x] **Vector Store:** Configure MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for storage (requires account and index setup).
*   [x] **Data Ingestion (Development):** Implement multi-source data ingestion framework (YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, Web Articles) and refactor `ingest_data.py` into a source router.
*   [x] **Data Ingestion (Testing):** Test the multi-source ingestion pipeline to ensure data is correctly processed and stored in MongoDB.
*   [x] **Retrieval:** Implement the core retrieval mechanism to perform similarity searches on the vector store. (Completed 6/6/2025 - Fixed collection name mismatch)
*   [x] **Generation:** Set up the LLM integration to generate responses based on retrieved context. (Completed 6/6/2025 - RAG chain implemented with ChatGoogleGenerativeAI, prompt template, and output parser. API returns answer and sources.)

## Estimated Time
40 hours (Estimated 16 hours so far)

## Status
Completed (6/6/2025)
*   **Data Ingestion Framework:** Implemented and tested multi-source data loaders (Markdown, GitHub, Web).
*   **Embedding:** Integrated Google Text Embedding 004.
*   **Vector Store:** Set up and integrated MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.
*   **Retrieval:** Implemented document retrieval based on similarity search.
*   **Generation:** Integrated Langchain with `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (gemini-pro) to generate answers from retrieved context.
*   **API:** `/api/v1/chat` endpoint created and functional, returning both the generated answer and source documents for transparency.
*   **Testing:** Standalone test script (`backend/test_rag_pipeline.py`) created to validate the end-to-end pipeline.
*   The core RAG pipeline is now functional.

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 1 (Project Initialization & Documentation Setup)
*   Completed: Milestone 2 (Basic Project Scaffold)

## Acceptance Criteria
*   [x] Langchain is successfully integrated into the FastAPI backend.
*   [x] The Google Text Embedding 004 model is functional and can create vectors (requires API key).
*   [x] MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is configured and accessible from the backend (requires account and index setup).
*   [x] The `ingest_data.py` script can be called with arguments for different data sources.
*   [x] The `ingest_data.py` script runs successfully without errors and populates the MongoDB collection with embedded data.
*   [x] A user query can successfully retrieve relevant document chunks from the vector store. (Verified 6/6/2025)
*   [x] The full pipeline can generate a coherent response using the LLM based on the retrieved documents. (Verified 6/6/2025 - Tested with `backend/test_rag_pipeline.py`, API returns answer and sources.)
