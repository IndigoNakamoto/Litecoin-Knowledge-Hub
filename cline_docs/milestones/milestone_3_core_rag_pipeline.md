# Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation

## Description
This milestone focuses on building the foundational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This includes setting up the Langchain framework, integrating with MongoDB Atlas for vector search, configuring the Google Text Embedding model, and implementing the initial data ingestion process.

## Key Tasks
*   [x] Set up Langchain project structure.
*   [x] Integrate Google Text Embedding 004 model.
*   [x] Configure MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for vector storage and retrieval.
*   [x] Develop initial data ingestion scripts for basic text data.
*   [ ] Implement the core retrieval mechanism.
*   [ ] Set up the LLM integration for generation.

## Estimated Time
40 hours (4 hours sofar)

## Status
In Progress (Data Ingestion & Langchain Setup Complete)

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 1 (Project Initialization & Documentation Setup)
*   Completed: Milestone 2 (Basic Project Scaffold)

## Acceptance Criteria
*   [x] Langchain is successfully integrated.
*   [x] Text embedding model is functional.
*   [x] MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is configured and accessible.
*   [x] Basic text data can be ingested and embedded into the vector store.
*   [ ] A simple query can retrieve relevant documents and generate a coherent response using the LLM.
