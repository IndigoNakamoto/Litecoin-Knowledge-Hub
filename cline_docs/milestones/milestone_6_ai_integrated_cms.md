# Milestone 6: AI-Integrated CMS (Payload CMS Integration)

## Description
This milestone outlines the strategic pivot from Strapi to Payload CMS, a modern, open-source headless CMS built with Node.js and TypeScript. The goal is to leverage Payload's robust features and direct MongoDB integration to manage the Litecoin Knowledge Base, ensuring content quality, data integrity, and a streamlined editorial workflow controlled by the Foundation. This approach provides a powerful, developer-friendly, and enterprise-grade solution while giving us full ownership over the data layer, which is critical for the RAG application.

## Primary Goals
*   **Establish a Self-Hosted Payload CMS Instance:** Set up and configure a secure, scalable Payload application.
*   **Define Structured Content:** Create flexible and well-defined content types (collections) for all knowledge base articles (e.g., FAQs, Deep Dives, Guides).
*   **Enable Seamless RAG Integration:** Ensure content can be efficiently retrieved, processed, and synchronized with the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store.
*   **Implement Foundation-Controlled Workflows:** Use Payload's built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage content creation, review, and publishing.

## Phases & Key Tasks

### Phase 1: Payload CMS Setup and Configuration
*   **Objective:** Establish a self-hosted Payload CMS instance tailored to our content management needs.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Provision a Payload instance with MongoDB as its database.
    *   Define content types (collections) (e.g., FAQs, documentation sections, articles) to structure the knowledge base.
    *   Configure RBAC to enforce the Foundation‚Äôs editorial workflow (e.g., Contributors, Editors, Administrators).
*   **Status:** üìù Planned

### Phase 2: Content API Integration
*   **Objective:** Enable seamless content retrieval from Payload for the RAG pipeline.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Develop a Python client to interact with Payload‚Äôs REST/GraphQL API.
    *   Adapt the content processor (`embedding_processor.py`) to handle Payload‚Äôs JSON content structure.
    *   Map Payload metadata to the RAG pipeline‚Äôs metadata schema.
*   **Status:** üìù Planned

### Phase 3: Synchronization Mechanism
*   **Objective:** Ensure real-time synchronization between Payload and the RAG vector store.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Configure Payload `afterChange` hooks to notify the RAG pipeline of content events (create, update, delete, publish, unpublish).
    *   Implement FastAPI webhook endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/sync/payload`) to process notifications.
    *   Test end-to-end synchronization to confirm real-time updates.
*   **Status:** üìù Planned

### Phase 4: Editorial Workflow Setup
*   **Objective:** Establish a Foundation-controlled editorial process within Payload.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Configure Payload user roles (e.g., Contributors, Editors, Administrators).
    *   Define workflows for content creation, review, and publishing.
    *   Train the Foundation team on Payload‚Äôs admin panel.
*   **Status:** üìù Planned

### Phase 5: Optimization and Advanced Features
*   **Objective:** Enhance Payload‚Äôs functionality and performance for the RAG application.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Identify and implement custom plugins or features specific to RAG needs (e.g., embedding status tracking).
    *   Optimize Payload‚Äôs performance (caching, database tuning).
    *   Set up monitoring and analytics for content management workflows.
*   **Status:** üìù Planned

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 3 (Core RAG Pipeline Implementation)
*   Completed: Milestone 4 (Backend & Knowledge Base Completion)

## Acceptance Criteria (Overall for Milestone 6)
*   A fully functional, self-hosted Payload CMS instance is deployed and configured.
*   The Payload CMS is fully integrated with the RAG pipeline, including real-time synchronization via `afterChange` hooks.
*   The Foundation's editorial workflow is established and operational within Payload's RBAC system.
*   The system is optimized for performance and monitored for health and efficiency.
