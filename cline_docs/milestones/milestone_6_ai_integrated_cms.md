# Milestone 6: Strapi CMS Integration

## Description
This milestone outlines the strategic pivot from a custom-built CMS to Strapi, a leading open-source headless CMS. The goal is to leverage Strapi's robust features to manage the Litecoin Knowledge Base, ensuring content quality, data integrity, and a streamlined editorial workflow controlled by the Foundation. This approach provides a powerful, enterprise-grade solution while giving us full ownership over the data layer, which is critical for the RAG application.

## Primary Goals
*   **Establish a Self-Hosted Strapi Instance:** Set up and configure a secure, scalable Strapi application.
*   **Define Structured Content:** Create flexible and well-defined content types for all knowledge base articles (e.g., FAQs, Deep Dives, Guides).
*   **Enable Seamless RAG Integration:** Ensure content can be efficiently retrieved, processed, and synchronized with the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store.
*   **Implement Foundation-Controlled Workflows:** Use Strapi's built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage content creation, review, and publishing.

## Phases & Key Tasks

### Phase 1: Strapi Setup and Configuration
*   **Objective:** Establish a self-hosted Strapi instance tailored to our content management needs.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Provision a Strapi instance with a preferred database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
    *   Define content types (e.g., FAQs, documentation sections, articles) to structure the knowledge base.
    *   Configure RBAC to enforce the Foundation‚Äôs editorial workflow (e.g., Contributors, Editors, Administrators).
*   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Completed**

### Phase 2: Content API Integration
*   **Objective:** Enable seamless content retrieval from Strapi for the RAG pipeline.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Develop a Python client to interact with Strapi‚Äôs REST API.
    *   Create a content processor (`embedding_processor_strapi.py`) to handle Strapi‚Äôs JSON format.
    *   Map Strapi metadata to the RAG pipeline‚Äôs metadata schema.
*   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Completed**

### Phase 3: Synchronization Mechanism
*   **Objective:** Ensure real-time synchronization between Strapi and the RAG vector store.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Configure Strapi webhooks to notify the RAG pipeline of content events (create, update, delete).
    *   Implement FastAPI webhook endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/sync/strapi`) to process notifications.
    *   Test end-to-end synchronization to confirm real-time updates.
*   **Status:** ‚úÖ **Completed**

### Phase 3a: Synchronization Testing
*   **Objective:** Thoroughly test and verify the end-to-end webhook synchronization.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Validate content creation, update, publish, unpublish, and deletion events.
    *   Confirm data integrity between Strapi and the vector store.
    *   Verify webhook security and error handling.
*   **Status:** üü® **In Progress**

### Phase 4: Editorial Workflow Setup
*   **Objective:** Establish a Foundation-controlled editorial process within Strapi.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Configure Strapi user roles (e.g., Contributors, Editors, Administrators).
    *   Define workflows for content creation, review, and publishing.
    *   Train the Foundation team on Strapi‚Äôs admin panel.
*   **Status:** üìù Planned

### Phase 5: Optimization and Advanced Features
*   **Objective:** Enhance Strapi‚Äôs functionality and performance for the RAG application.
*   **Key Actions:**
    *   Identify and implement custom plugins or features specific to RAG needs (e.g., embedding status tracking).
    *   Optimize Strapi‚Äôs performance (caching, database tuning).
    *   Set up monitoring and analytics for content management workflows.
*   **Status:** üìù Planned

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 3 (Core RAG Pipeline Implementation)
*   Completed: Milestone 4 (Backend & Knowledge Base Completion)

## Acceptance Criteria (Overall for Milestone 6)
*   A fully functional, self-hosted Strapi instance is deployed and configured.
*   The Strapi CMS is fully integrated with the RAG pipeline, including real-time synchronization via webhooks.
*   The Foundation's editorial workflow is established and operational within Strapi's RBAC system.
*   The system is optimized for performance and monitored for health and efficiency.
