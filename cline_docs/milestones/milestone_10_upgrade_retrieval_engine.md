# Milestone 10: Upgrade Retrieval Engine

## Description
This milestone focuses on enhancing document retrieval accuracy by combining vector similarity with keyword search (hybrid search) and re-ranking retrieved documents for optimal relevance.

## Key Tasks
*   Implement a hybrid search mechanism that combines vector similarity and keyword search.
*   Implement a re-ranking mechanism to re-rank retrieved documents for optimal relevance.

## Status
Planned

## Dependencies
*   Planned: Milestone 9 (Implement Contextual Discovery)

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The retrieval engine uses a hybrid search approach to retrieve documents.
*   The retrieval engine re-ranks retrieved documents to improve relevance.
*   The overall accuracy of the RAG pipeline is improved.
