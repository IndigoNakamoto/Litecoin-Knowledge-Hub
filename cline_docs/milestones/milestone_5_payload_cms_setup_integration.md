# Milestone 5: Payload CMS Setup & Integration

## Description
This milestone focuses on configuring the self-hosted Payload CMS instance and integrating its API and webhooks with the backend RAG pipeline. This is a critical step to enable a robust, Foundation-controlled editorial workflow.

## Key Tasks
*   Set up and configure a self-hosted Payload CMS instance with a MongoDB database.
*   Define Payload collections to accurately structure the knowledge base articles.
*   Configure Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) for Foundation editors and community contributors.
*   Implement Payload's `afterChange` hooks to trigger the Content Sync Service upon publishing content.
*   Develop the Content Sync Service to fetch and process content from the Payload CMS API.
*   Adapt the Embedding Processor to correctly parse, chunk, and prepare content from Payload for the vector store.
*   Conduct end-to-end tests to confirm that content published in Payload is successfully ingested into the RAG pipeline.
*   Update project documentation to reflect the final Payload CMS integration architecture.

## Status
In Progress (as per `currentTask.md`)

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 4 (Backend & Knowledge Base Completion)

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A self-hosted Payload CMS instance is successfully deployed and configured.
*   Payload collections are defined to accurately structure the knowledge base articles.
*   Role-based access controls (RBAC) are configured for Foundation editors and community contributors.
*   Payload's `afterChange` hooks are implemented to trigger the Content Sync Service upon publishing content.
*   The Content Sync Service successfully fetches and processes content from the Payload CMS API.
*   The Embedding Processor correctly parses, chunks, and prepares content from Payload for the vector store.
*   End-to-end tests confirm that content published in Payload is successfully ingested into the RAG pipeline.
*   Relevant project documents (`techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`, `README.md`) are updated to reflect the final Payload CMS integration architecture.
