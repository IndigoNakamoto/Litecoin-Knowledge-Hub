# Milestone 7: MVP Feature 4 Implementation (Developer Documentation & Resources)

## Description
This milestone focuses on implementing the developer documentation and resources feature. This involves ingesting relevant Litecoin developer documentation into the RAG system, creating a searchable index, and enabling the system to provide accurate code snippets, links to key resources, and answers to common technical questions for developers.

## Key Tasks
*   Identify and curate official Litecoin developer documentation and key resources (e.g., GitHub repos, LIPs).
*   Implement data ingestion for developer documentation, potentially handling various formats (Markdown, PDF, etc.).
*   Optimize embedding and retrieval for technical content, including code snippets.
*   Refine RAG pipeline to accurately answer developer-centric queries.
*   Develop frontend components to display technical answers and links clearly.

## Estimated Time
45 hours

## Dependencies
*   Completed: Milestone 3 (Core RAG Pipeline Implementation)
*   Completed: Milestone 4 (Litecoin Basics & FAQ)

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Users can successfully query for Litecoin developer documentation and resources.
*   The system provides accurate code snippets and relevant links.
*   Technical questions are answered clearly and concisely.
*   Developer documentation is successfully ingested and searchable.
