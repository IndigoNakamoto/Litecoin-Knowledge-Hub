# Current Task: Litecoin Knowledge Hub

## Current Sprint/Iteration Goal
*   **Milestone 8: Testing, Refinement & Deployment**

## High-Priority Initiatives: End-to-End Testing

## Active Task(s):
*   ### Task ID: `E2E-TEST-001`
    *   #### Name: Full Stack End-to-End Test with Strapi Content
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Now that the Strapi integration is complete and verified, it is time to conduct a full end-to-end test of the entire system. This involves populating Strapi with a set of test articles, running all components of the application stack (Frontend, Backend, Strapi), and verifying that the chat interface can correctly retrieve and generate answers based on the content managed in the CMS.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  A set of test articles are created and published in Strapi.
        2.  The Strapi, FastAPI, and Next.js development servers are all running concurrently.
        3.  The frontend chat application successfully connects to the backend.
        4.  User queries related to the content of the test articles return accurate and relevant answers from the RAG pipeline.
        5.  The chat interface displays the sources of the retrieved information correctly.

## Task Backlog:
*   ### Task ID: `RAG-OPT-001`
    *   #### Name: Implement Query Optimization and Hybrid Search
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Update the RAG retrieval logic to leverage the new structured chunks and rich metadata. This involves implementing hybrid search (a combination of vector search and metadata-based filtering) to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved documents. This is the final step to fully realize the benefits of the new chunking strategy.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  The core retrieval function in `rag_pipeline.py` is updated to accept metadata filters.
        2.  The chat API is updated to intelligently construct filters based on the user's query.
        3.  Section-aware retrieval is implemented (e.g., prioritizing `title_summary` chunks for overview questions).
        4.  End-to-end tests validate that hybrid search improves retrieval relevance for a variety of query types.
