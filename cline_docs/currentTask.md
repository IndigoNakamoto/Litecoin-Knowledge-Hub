# Current Task: Litecoin RAG Chat

## Current Sprint/Iteration Goal
*   Core RAG Pipeline Implementation.

## Active Task(s):
*   ### Task ID / Name: `RAG-001` - Implement Data Ingestion and MongoDB Vector Store Setup
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task focused on setting up the foundational components for data ingestion and vector storage within our RAG pipeline. This included identifying initial data sources for Litecoin information, developing modules to ingest and process this data, generating embeddings using Google Text Embedding 004, and storing these embeddings in MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. The multi-source ingestion framework is now complete in terms of code, but requires environment setup and testing.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  A new directory `backend/data_ingestion/` is created.
        2.  `pymongo` and `langchain-google-genai` are added to `backend/requirements.txt`.
        3.  `backend/data_ingestion/litecoin_docs_loader.py` is created with a function to load sample Litecoin documentation (e.g., from a local markdown file or a small, static text).
        4.  `backend/data_ingestion/embedding_processor.py` is created to handle text splitting and generate embeddings using Google Text Embedding 004.
        5.  `backend/data_ingestion/vector_store_manager.py` is created to manage connections to MongoDB Atlas and insert/retrieve vector embeddings.
        6.  A standalone script `backend/ingest_data.py` is created to orchestrate the data loading, embedding, and storage process, now supporting multiple sources via command-line arguments.
        7.  The ingestion script runs successfully without errors and populates the MongoDB Atlas collection with embedded data from various sources.

    *   #### Status: Development Complete - Ready for Testing

*   ### Task ID / Name: `RAG-002` - Implement Retriever for RAG Pipeline
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task involves creating the "retrieval" part of the RAG pipeline. We will modify `backend/rag_pipeline.py` to accept a user query, use the MongoDB vector store to find the most relevant document chunks from our knowledge base, and then pass these chunks as context to the language model. This is the core of the "Retrieval-Augmented" process.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  Create a new function in `backend/rag_pipeline.py` that takes a user query as input.
        2.  The function should initialize the `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch` store.
        3.  The function should perform a similarity search on the vector store using the user's query to retrieve relevant documents.
        4.  The retrieved documents should be formatted and returned.
        5.  The `/api/v1/chat` endpoint in `backend/main.py` should be updated to call this new retrieval function.
        6.  For now, the endpoint can return the retrieved documents directly as a JSON response for testing purposes.

    *   #### Status: To Do

## Discovered During Work:
*   The data ingestion script depends on a manually created Vector Search Index in MongoDB Atlas. Added a user instruction guide and updated the task steps to reflect this dependency.

## Task Backlog:
*   ### Task ID / Name: `ARCH-001` - Implement Session Management
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Inspired by the "Building a Simple Full Stack RAG-Bot for Enterprises" article, this task focuses on implementing a session management mechanism, such as using a `group_id` or similar identifier, to track user interactions. This will be crucial for maintaining conversation history and laying the groundwork for future multi-user or personalized features, even if the initial MVP uses a shared knowledge base.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  A mechanism for generating and associating a unique session ID (e.g., `group_id`) with each user interaction is implemented in the backend.
        2.  The session ID is passed between the frontend and backend for each query.
        3.  The backend can retrieve or store information based on this session ID (e.g., conversation history, if implemented later).

*   ### Task ID / Name: `RESEARCH-001` - Research MongoDB Atlas Vector Search Advanced Capabilities
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        The "Building a Simple Full Stack RAG-Bot for Enterprises" article highlighted Qdrant's multitenancy and binary quantization features for data isolation and performance. This task involves researching how similar capabilities can be achieved or leveraged with MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. This research will inform future architectural decisions regarding data partitioning, security, and performance optimization for our vector store.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  Documentation and examples for achieving data isolation (e.g., multi-tenancy, filtering by metadata) within MongoDB Atlas Vector Search are identified.
        2.  Information on performance optimization techniques (e.g., indexing strategies, data compression, query optimization) specific to MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is gathered.
        3.  A brief summary of findings is documented, outlining how these capabilities can be applied to our project.

*   ### Task ID / Name: `INIT-003` - Basic Langchain Setup in Backend
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task involves integrating Langchain into the FastAPI backend. We will add Langchain as a dependency and create a foundational structure for our RAG pipeline. This includes setting up a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/chat`) that can receive a user query. For now, this endpoint will use a very basic Langchain chain (e.g., a prompt template and a placeholder component) to process the query and return a placeholder response. This initial step verifies that Langchain is correctly integrated and operational within our backend environment before we build out the more complex data ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and generation components.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria Met:
        1.  `langchain`, `langchain-core`, and `langchain-community` were added to `backend/requirements.txt`.
        2.  `backend/rag_pipeline.py` was created to encapsulate Langchain-related logic.
        3.  `backend/main.py` imports from `backend/rag_pipeline.py`.
        4.  The POST API endpoint `/api/v1/chat` was added to `backend/main.py`.
        5.  The endpoint uses a simple Langchain chain.
        6.  The endpoint returns a JSON response with a placeholder.
        7.  The FastAPI backend server can run without errors.

This task lays the foundational codebase for subsequent feature development.
    *   #### Notes on Completion:
        *   The initial scaffold had a Git submodule conflict. The project state was reset, and the frontend and backend were re-scaffolded correctly on 6/5/2025.

        *   Root project directory contains `frontend/` and `backend/` subdirectories.
        *   `frontend/` is initialized as a Next.js project without a nested Git repository.
