## Legacy Tasks (Deprecated due to Ghost CMS Integration):

*   ### Task ID: `CMS-IMP-001` - DEPRECATED
    *   #### Name: CMS Implementation - Phase 1: Core Setup & Basic Content Management
    *   #### Status: Deprecated
    *   #### Notes: This task has been superseded by the Ghost CMS integration strategy. The custom CMS development approach has been abandoned in favor of leveraging Ghost's enterprise-grade content management capabilities.

*   ### Task ID: `CMS-IMP-002` - DEPRECATED
    *   #### Name: CMS Implementation - Phase 2: Semantic Search Implementation
    *   #### Status: Deprecated
    *   #### Notes: Semantic search functionality will be maintained in the RAG pipeline and accessed through Ghost's Content API integration rather than custom CMS search implementation.

*   ### Task ID: `CMS-IMP-003` - DEPRECATED
    *   #### Name: CMS Implementation - Phase 3: Refinement & Advanced Features
    *   #### Status: Deprecated
    *   #### Notes: Advanced features will be implemented through Ghost CMS extensions and integrations rather than custom development.

## Development Notes:

### Ghost CMS Integration Architecture
The integration follows this architectural pattern:
```
Ghost CMS (MySQL) → Content API → RAG Sync Service → MongoDB Vector Store
                  ↓
              Webhooks → Real-time Updates
```

### Key Integration Points:
1.  **Content Retrieval:** Ghost Content API provides comprehensive access to posts, metadata, and relationships
2.  **Real-time Sync:** Ghost webhooks trigger immediate RAG pipeline updates when content changes
3.  **Content Processing:** HTML-to-Markdown conversion preserves hierarchical structure for optimal chunking
4.  **Metadata Mapping:** Ghost API metadata fields map to RAG pipeline metadata schema

### Technical Considerations:
*   **Database Separation:** Ghost uses MySQL for content storage, RAG pipeline continues using MongoDB for vectors
*   **Content Format:** Ghost HTML content converted to Markdown for RAG processing compatibility
*   **Authentication:** Ghost Content API uses read-only keys, Admin API uses JWT for content management
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for webhook failures, API timeouts, and content processing issues
