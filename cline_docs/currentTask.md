# Current Task: Litecoin RAG Chat

## Current Sprint/Iteration Goal
*   Project Initialization and Foundational Setup.

## Active Task(s):
*   (None currently active)

## Discovered During Work:
*   (None)

## Task Backlog:
*   (To be populated as project progresses)

## Recently Completed Tasks:
*   ### Task ID / Name: `INIT-003` - Basic Langchain Setup in Backend
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task involves integrating Langchain into the FastAPI backend. We will add Langchain as a dependency and create a foundational structure for our RAG pipeline. This includes setting up a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/chat`) that can receive a user query. For now, this endpoint will use a very basic Langchain chain (e.g., a prompt template and a placeholder component) to process the query and return a placeholder response. This initial step verifies that Langchain is correctly integrated and operational within our backend environment before we build out the more complex data ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and generation components.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria Met:
        1.  `langchain`, `langchain-core`, and `langchain-community` were added to `backend/requirements.txt`.
        2.  `backend/rag_pipeline.py` was created to encapsulate Langchain-related logic.
        3.  `backend/main.py` imports from `backend/rag_pipeline.py`.
        4.  The POST API endpoint `/api/v1/chat` was added to `backend/main.py`.
        5.  The endpoint uses a simple Langchain chain.
        6.  The endpoint returns a JSON response with a placeholder.
        7.  The FastAPI backend server can run without errors.

        *   Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation (Initial setup)
    *   #### Status: Done (6/5/2025)
*   ### Task ID / Name: `INIT-002` - Scaffold Initial Project Structure
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Set up the basic directory structure for the Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend. Initialize project files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`), and set up basic "Hello World" endpoints for both frontend and backend to ensure the initial setup is working. This task lays the foundational codebase for subsequent feature development.
    *   #### Notes on Completion:
        *   The initial scaffold had a Git submodule conflict. The project state was reset, and the frontend and backend were re-scaffolded correctly on 6/5/2025.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        *   Root project directory contains `frontend/` and `backend/` subdirectories.
        *   `frontend/` is initialized as a Next.js project without a nested Git repository.
        *   `backend/` is set up for a FastAPI project.
        *   The root Git repository correctly tracks all files in `frontend/` and `backend/`.

    *   #### Status: Done (6/5/2025)
*   ### Task ID / Name: `INIT-001` - Project Initialization and Documentation Setup
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Based on the information provided in the "Initiate New Project" prompt, this task was to:
        1.  Thoroughly review and internalize custom instructions (Unified Cline Super-Prompt).
        2.  Perform "Pre-Task Analysis & Planning" thinking step.
        3.  Populate the initial versions of all four `cline_docs` files (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`) with the information provided and any reasonable defaults or placeholders where information is missing.
        4.  For `currentTask.md`, detail this `INIT-001` task and then define and plan the *next logical development task*.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria Met:
        *   All four `cline_docs` files created/populated in the project's `cline_docs` directory.
        *   `projectRoadmap.md` reflects the initial vision, goals, and features (including user-guided feature definitions).
        *   `techStack.md` outlines initial technology considerations.
        *   `currentTask.md` details `INIT-001` as "Done" and clearly defines `INIT-002`.
        *   `codebaseSummary.md` created.
        *   `session_summary.md` was presented (conceptually, as part of the PLAN MODE response).
