# Current Task: Litecoin RAG Chat

## Current Sprint/Iteration Goal
*   **Milestone 4: MVP Feature 1 Implementation (Litecoin Basics & FAQ)**

## Active Task(s):

*   ### Task ID: `M4-DATASRC-001`
    *   #### Name: Implement CRUD API for Data Source Management
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        To effectively manage the knowledge base of the RAG system, we need a dedicated way to track and control the data sources being ingested. This task involves creating a new set of API endpoints to handle the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for data sources. This will provide a foundational mechanism for adding, viewing, modifying, and removing sources, ensuring that the RAG pipeline is always working with a well-curated and up-to-date set of information.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  A `DataSource` Pydantic model is defined in a new `backend/data_models.py` file.
        2.  A new MongoDB collection named `data_sources` is used to store the source records.
        3.  A new API router is created at `backend/api/v1/sources.py`.
        4.  The following API endpoints are implemented and functional:
            *   `POST /api/v1/sources`: Creates a new data source record.
            *   `GET /api/v1/sources`: Retrieves all data source records.
            *   `GET /api/v1/sources/{source_id}`: Retrieves a single data source record.
            *   `PUT /api/v1/sources/{source_id}`: Updates an existing data source record.
            *   `DELETE /api/v1/sources/{source_id}`: Deletes a data source record.
        5.  Crucially, the `DELETE` endpoint must also remove all associated document chunks from the `litecoin_docs` vector store to prevent data orphans.
        6.  The new router is correctly integrated into the main FastAPI application in `backend/main.py`.
        7.  A new test file, `backend/test_sources_api.py`, is created with tests for each CRUD endpoint.

    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Connect the frontend chat interface to the backend `/api/v1/chat` endpoint. This involves handling user input submission, making a POST request to the backend with the query, and then processing and displaying the JSON response (`answer` and `sources`) in the UI.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  Submitting a query in the frontend triggers a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat`.
        2.  The `answer` from the API response is displayed in the chat interface.
        3.  The `sources` from the API response are displayed alongside the answer, showing the origin of the information.
        4.  Loading and error states are handled gracefully in the UI.

*   ### Task ID / Name: `RAG-003` - Implement Generator for RAG Pipeline
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task involves creating the "generation" part of the RAG pipeline. We will modify `backend/rag_pipeline.py` to take the retrieved document chunks, format them into a prompt, and pass them to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a coherent and contextually relevant answer to the user's query.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  Modify the `retrieve_documents` function (or create a new one) in `backend/rag_pipeline.py` to include the generation step.
        2.  Initialize a suitable LLM from Langchain (e.g., `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`).
        3.  Create a prompt template that incorporates the retrieved documents and the user's query.
        4.  Construct a Langchain chain that passes the query to the retriever, then the retrieved documents and query to the prompt template, and finally to the LLM.
        5.  The `/api/v1/chat` endpoint in `backend/main.py` should be updated to call this new RAG chain.
        6.  The endpoint should return the LLM-generated response as a JSON object (e.g., `{"response": "generated_answer"}`).
    *   #### Link to projectRoadmap.md goal(s):
        *   Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation (Data Ingestion, Embedding, Retrieval, Generation)
    *   #### Status: Done (6/6/2025)
    *   #### Notes on Completion:
        *   Modified `backend/rag_pipeline.py` to implement a full RAG chain using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).
        *   The chain now includes:
            *   A retriever using `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch`.
            *   A prompt template (`RAG_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`) to format the query and context.
            *   The `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` model (gemini-pro) as the LLM.
            *   An output parser (`StrOutputParser`) to get the final string response.
        *   The `retrieve_documents` function is still present but no longer directly called by the main API; its logic is incorporated into the new `get_rag_chain` function's retriever.
        *   Removed the `get_placeholder_chain` function.
        *   Updated `backend/main.py`'s `/api/v1/chat` endpoint to use the new `get_rag_chain` function.
        *   The endpoint now returns the LLM-generated response in the format `{"response": "generated_answer"}`.
        *   All acceptance criteria for RAG-003 have been met.

*   ### Task ID / Name: `TEST-002` - Validate Multi-Source Ingestion Loaders
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task addresses the gap identified during the review of `RAG-001`. While the ingestion framework supports multiple data sources, only the `markdown` loader was validated in `TEST-001`. This task will systematically test each of the other implemented data loaders (`youtube`, `twitter`, `github`, `web`) to confirm they correctly ingest, process, and store data in the MongoDB vector store. This ensures the reliability of our entire data pipeline.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  The `ingest_data.py` script is successfully executed for each of the following source types with a valid, publicly accessible identifier: `youtube`, `twitter`, `github`, and `web`.
        2.  After each execution, verification is performed to confirm that new documents have been added to the MongoDB collection.
        3.  A spot-check of the newly added documents confirms that the `page_content` is reasonable and the `metadata` field correctly identifies the source type and identifier.
        4.  The task is marked as "Done" upon successful validation of all loaders.
    *   #### Link to projectRoadmap.md goal(s):
        *   Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation (Testing)
    *   #### Status: Done (6/6/2025)
    *   #### Notes on Completion:
        *   **Markdown Loader:** Passed.
        *   **GitHub Loader:** Passed after a patch was applied to handle repositories with a `master` default branch instead of `main`.
        *   **Web Loader:** Passed after a patch was applied to fix an `AttributeError` related to timestamp generation.
        *   **Twitter Loader:** Skipped. Requires a `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable to be set.
        *   **YouTube Loader:** Skipped. Requires a local instance of the Citeio application running on `http://localhost:8001`.

*   ### Task ID / Name: `RAG-002` - Implement Retriever for RAG Pipeline
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task involves creating the "retrieval" part of the RAG pipeline. We will modify `backend/rag_pipeline.py` to accept a user query, use the MongoDB vector store to find the most relevant document chunks from our knowledge base, and then pass these chunks as context to the language model. This is the core of the "Retrieval-Augmented" process.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        1.  Create a new function in `backend/rag_pipeline.py` that takes a user query as input.
        2.  The function should initialize the `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch` store.
        3.  The function should perform a similarity search on the vector store using the user's query to retrieve relevant documents.
        4.  The retrieved documents should be formatted and returned.
        5.  The `/api/v1/chat` endpoint in `backend/main.py` should be updated to call this new retrieval function.
        6.  For now, the endpoint can return the retrieved documents directly as a JSON response for testing purposes.
    *   #### Link to projectRoadmap.md goal(s):
        *   Milestone 3: Core RAG Pipeline Implementation (Data Ingestion, Embedding, Retrieval, Generation)
    *   #### Status: Done (6/6/2025)
    *   #### Notes on Completion:
        *   Created a `retrieve_documents` function in `backend/rag_pipeline.py` that connects to the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store and performs a similarity search.
        *   Updated the `/api/v1/chat` endpoint in `backend/main.py` to call this new function.
        *   The endpoint now returns the retrieved documents as a JSON response, fulfilling the acceptance criteria for testing the retrieval step in isolation.
        *   **Fix (6/6/2025):** Corrected `COLLECTION_NAME` in `backend/rag_pipeline.py` from `"docs"` to `"litecoin_docs"` to match the ingestion setup, resolving an issue where no documents were being retrieved.
        
*   ### Task ID / Name: `TEST-002` - Validate Multi-Source Ingestion Loaders
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task addresses the gap identified during the review of `RAG-001`. While the ingestion framework supports multiple data sources, only the `markdown` loader was validated in `TEST-001`.

This ensures the reliability of our entire data pipeline.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria Met:
        1.  The `ingest_data.py` script was successfully executed for the `markdown`, `github`, and `web` source types.
        2.  The `twitter` and `youtube` loaders were skipped due to external dependencies (API keys and a local service).
        3.  Verification of the `markdown`, `github`, and `web` loaders confirmed that new documents were added to the MongoDB collection with correct content and metadata.

    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Refactored the `backend/ingest_data.py` script to act as a router, dynamically calling the appropriate loader based on the input source type and identifier.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria Met:
        1.  `backend/ingest_data.py` was modified to import new loaders.
        2.  The `main` function in `backend/ingest_data.py` was updated to accept `source_type` and `source_identifier` arguments.
        3.  Conditional logic was added to call the correct loader based on `source_type`.
        4.  The script now uses `argparse` for command-line arguments.

*   ### Task ID / Name: `INIT-003` - Basic Langchain Setup in Backend
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        This task involves integrating Langchain into the FastAPI backend. We will add Langchain as a dependency and create a foundational structure for our RAG pipeline. This includes setting up a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/chat`) that can receive a user query. For now, this endpoint will use a very basic Langchain chain (e.g., a prompt template and a placeholder component) to process the query and return a placeholder response. This initial step verifies that Langchain is correctly integrated and operational within our backend environment before we build out the more complex data ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and generation components.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria Met:
        1.  `langchain`, `langchain-core`, and `langchain-community` were added to `backend/requirements.txt`.
        2.  `backend/rag_pipeline.py` was created to encapsulate Langchain-related logic.
        3.  `backend/main.py` imports from `backend/rag_pipeline.py`.
        4.  The POST API endpoint `/api/v1/chat` was added to `backend/main.py`.
        5.  The endpoint uses a simple Langchain chain.
        6.  The endpoint returns a JSON response with a placeholder.
        7.  The FastAPI backend server can run without errors.

*   ### Task ID / Name: `INIT-002` - Scaffold Initial Project Structure
    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Set up the basic directory structure for the Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend. Initialize project files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`), and set up basic "Hello World" endpoints for both frontend and backend to ensure the initial setup is working. This task lays the foundational codebase for subsequent feature development.
    *   #### Notes on Completion:
        *   The initial scaffold had a Git submodule conflict. The project state was reset, and the frontend and backend were re-scaffolded correctly on 6/5/2025.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria:
        *   Root project directory contains `frontend/` and `backend/` subdirectories.
        *   `frontend/` is initialized as a Next.js project without a nested Git repository.
        *   `backend/` is set up for a FastAPI project.
        *   The root Git repository correctly tracks all files in `frontend/` and `backend/`.

    *   #### Detailed Description & Business Context:
        Based on the information provided in the "Initiate New Project" prompt, this task was to:
        1.  Thoroughly review and internalize custom instructions (Unified Cline Super-Prompt).
        2.  Perform "Pre-Task Analysis & Planning" thinking step.
        3.  Populate the initial versions of all four `cline_docs` files (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`) with the information provided and any reasonable defaults or placeholders where information is missing.
        4.  For `currentTask.md`, detail this `INIT-001` task and then define and plan the *next logical development task*.
    *   #### Acceptance Criteria Met:
        *   All four `cline_docs` files created/populated in the project's `cline_docs` directory.
        *   `projectRoadmap.md` reflects the initial vision, goals, and features (including user-guided feature definitions).
        *   `techStack.md` outlines initial technology considerations.
        *   `currentTask.md` details `INIT-001` as "Done" and clearly defines `INIT-002`.
        *   `codebaseSummary.md` created.
        *   `session_summary.md` was presented (conceptually, as part of the PLAN MODE response).
