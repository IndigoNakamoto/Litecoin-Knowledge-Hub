# Introduction to Litecoin

## What is Litecoin?
Litecoin (LTC) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Inspired by Bitcoin, Litecoin was among the earliest altcoins, starting in October 2011. In technical details, the Litecoin main chain shares a slightly modified Bitcoin Core codebase.

## Key Differences from Bitcoin
- **Hashing Algorithm:** Litecoin uses Scrypt, a memory-hard algorithm, for its proof-of-work. Bitcoin uses SHA-256.
- **Block Time:** Litecoin's network aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes. This allows for faster transaction confirmations.
- **Total Supply:** Litecoin has a maximum supply of 84 million coins, four times as many as Bitcoin.

## How Transactions Work
A Litecoin transaction is a transfer of value between Litecoin wallets that gets included in the blockchain. When a user initiates a transaction, it is broadcast to the network and collected by miners to be included in a new block. Each transaction must be digitally signed using the sender's private key, which provides mathematical proof that it has come from the owner of the wallet.
