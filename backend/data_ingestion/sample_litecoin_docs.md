### Survey Note: Comprehensive History of Litecoin

Litecoin (LTC) is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project, created as an alternative to Bitcoin with the goal of addressing some of its limitations, such as slower transaction confirmation times and the increasing difficulty of mining with CPUs. Below is a detailed examination of its history, evolution, and significance, drawing from multiple reliable sources including Wikipedia, Investopedia, and the official Litecoin website.

#### **Pre-Litecoin Context**
Before Litecoin's creation, the cryptocurrency landscape was dominated by Bitcoin, which by 2011 had shifted its mining process largely to GPUs. This raised concerns among users about the high barrier to entry for CPU miners, as GPU mining required significant investment in hardware. In response, Tenebrix (TBX) was developed, using the Scrypt hashing algorithm instead of Bitcoin's SHA-256. Scrypt was designed to be more GPU-resistant, better utilizing CPU resources, but Tenebrix faced criticism due to a clause allowing its developers to claim 7.7 million TBX, raising concerns about centralization. Charlie Lee, a former Google engineer and later a director at Coinbase, created Fairbrix (FBX), which inherited Scrypt from Tenebrix but returned to Bitcoin's limited money supply model, setting the stage for Litecoin.

#### **Creation and Launch (October 2011)**
Litecoin was officially released on October 7, 2011, by Charlie Lee, with the network going live on October 13, 2011. It was a source code fork of Bitcoin Core, but with several key modifications:
- **Algorithm**: It uses the Scrypt hashing algorithm instead of SHA-256, making it more resistant to large-scale hardware attacks, as noted by [Scrypt documentation](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html).
- **Block Time**: Litecoin generates blocks every 2.5 minutes, compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes, allowing for faster transaction confirmations.
- **Coin Supply**: It has a maximum supply of 84 million LTC, four times Bitcoin's 21 million BTC limit.
- Initially described as "a lite version of Bitcoin," Litecoin was positioned as the "silver to Bitcoin's gold," highlighting its complementary role.

The project was released under the MIT/X11 license, ensuring an open-source, transparent process for independent verification of binaries and source code, with resources available at [Litecoin Wiki](http://litecoin.info) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/litecoin-project).

#### **Early Growth and Market Adoption (2011–2016)**
Litecoin's early growth was aided by its availability on cryptocurrency exchanges, with increasing liquidity on platforms like BTC-e. A significant milestone occurred in November 2013, when Litecoin's value surged by 100% within 24 hours, reflecting its growing popularity and market acceptance. This period established Litecoin as one of the first successful altcoins, competing with Bitcoin and gaining a foothold in the emerging cryptocurrency ecosystem.

#### **Key Technological Developments (2014–2022)**
Litecoin's evolution included several pivotal upgrades:
- **2014**: Charlie Lee suggested merge mining Dogecoin with Litecoin, which began in September 2014. This allowed miners to mine both cryptocurrencies simultaneously, increasing efficiency and supporting Dogecoin's network.
- **2017**: Litecoin adopted SegWit (Segregated Witness), a protocol upgrade that was first tested on Litecoin before being implemented on Bitcoin, as detailed by [Investopedia on SegWit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp). This improved transaction capacity and reduced fees, enhancing scalability.
- **2018**: The Lightning Network was integrated, enabling faster and cheaper off-chain transactions, further aligning with Litecoin's goal of quick payments, as explained by [Investopedia on Lightning Network](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lightning-network.asp).
- **2020**: PayPal added the ability for users to purchase Litecoin (along with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash) as part of its Crypto feature, although users could not withdraw or spend the cryptocurrency at that time, limiting its utility.
- **2021**: A notable controversy arose in September 2021 when a fake press release on GlobeNewswire announced a partnership between Litecoin and Walmart, causing Litecoin's price to spike by around 30%. It was later revealed as a hoax, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/press-release-walmarts-litecoin-partnership-is-fake-cnbc-2021-09-13/).
- **2022**: 
  - In May 2022, Litecoin activated the MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks) upgrade through a soft fork, providing optional privacy features for confidential transactions, as announced on [Litecoin's official news](https://www.litecoin.net/news/mweb-has-officially-activated).
  - In June 2022, PayPal expanded its Crypto feature to allow users to transfer Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash between wallets and exchanges, enhancing its usability.

#### **Recent Developments (2024–2025)**
Recent years have seen continued innovation:
- **March 2024**: Litecoin Core v0 was released, involving vital security improvements and other changes to the network, as noted by [Reverbico](https://reverbico.com/blog/a-detailed-look-at-roadmap-and-future-goals-of-litecoin/).
- **June 2025**: Litecoin launched LitVM, a Layer-2 network leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, enhancing scalability and privacy, as reported by [Messari](https://messari.io/project/litecoin). This development aims to address growing demands for efficient, scalable transactions.

#### **Technical and Market Details**
Litecoin's technical specifications include:
- **Block Reward**: Initially, miners were awarded 50 LTC per block, halving every 840,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years). As of 2023, the block reward is 6.25 LTC, with the next halving expected around 2027.
- **Supply**: As of December 2024, over 75,310,895 LTC were in circulation, with a total supply limit of 84 million, as per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin).
- **Market Value**: As of May 2024, Litecoin had a market value of $6.02 billion, placing it among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/litecoin.asp).
- **Price History**: Litecoin's price has been volatile, peaking at around $250 in both 2017 and 2020, and reaching an all-time high of $386.45 in May 2021, as noted by [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/). As of recent data, its price fluctuated, with a notable 62% increase since April 2025, outperforming Bitcoin, as reported by [CCN](https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/litecoin-price-analysis-five-year-pattern/).

A comparison with Bitcoin highlights key differences, as shown in the following table:

| Attribute               | Bitcoin                     | Litecoin                    |

Litecoin's use of Scrypt makes large-scale hardware attacks more difficult, and as of May 2024, it had over 74 million coins in circulation, reflecting its established presence.

#### **Significance and Future Outlook**
Litecoin is often considered the first successful altcoin and has served as a testing ground for Bitcoin improvements, such as SegWit and the Lightning Network. Its faster transaction times and lower fees make it suitable for everyday transactions, complementing Bitcoin's store-of-value narrative. Charlie Lee, the founder, has expressed confidence that Litecoin will remain one of the few enduring cryptocurrencies due to its established infrastructure and community, as noted in discussions on [Wharton Knowledge](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/litecoin/). Despite waning popularity due to market saturation, it continues to innovate, with recent developments like LitVM reinforcing its relevance.

#### **Challenges and Controversies**
Litecoin has faced challenges, including market volatility and the 2021 Walmart partnership hoax, which temporarily affected its price and reputation. However, its community and ongoing upgrades demonstrate resilience, maintaining its position in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape.

This comprehensive history underscores Litecoin's evolution from a Bitcoin fork to a significant cryptocurrency with ongoing innovations, ensuring its place in the digital economy as of June 2025.
